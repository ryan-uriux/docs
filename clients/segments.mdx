# What is a segment?

A **Segment** in Panel Pro is a **dynamic group of panelists** that updates in real time based on a set of conditions you define. Segments help you find the right people for your research by applying filters across a wide range of data points collected from panelists.

# What Can You Segment On?

## Panel Pro Questions

In Panel Pro, you can segment on just about anything, but the most common use case is segmenting on responses to questions.  Out of the box, Panel Pro includes pre-profiled panelists who have already responded to dozens, if not hundreds, of questions.  Questions issued to panelists by Panel Pro are "global" questions that are shared across clients, and are useful for creating high level segments.

## Your Team's Questions

Panel Pro also allows you to survey on your own questions - questions that you've sent to panelists via the Survey feature in the platform.  The responses to these questions are scoped to your team, and are never shared across clients.  This means you can ask panelists very specific questions that are relevant to your profile needs, then use the responses to these questions as conditions for your segments.
