# What is a segment?

A **Segment** in Panel Pro is a **dynamic group of panelists** that updates in real time based on a set of conditions you define. Segments help you find the right people for your research by applying filters across a wide range of data points collected from panelists.

# What Can You Segment On?

## Panel Pro Questions

In Panel Pro, you can segment on just about anything, but the most common use case is segmenting on responses to questions.  Out of the box, Panel Pro includes pre-profiled panelists who have already responded to dozens, if not hundreds, of questions.  Questions issued to panelists by Panel Pro are "global" questions that are shared across clients, and are useful for creating high level segments.

## Your Team's Questions

Panel Pro also allows you to survey on your own questions - questions that you've sent to panelists via the Survey feature in the platform.  The responses to these questions are scoped to your team, and are never shared across clients.  This means you can ask panelists very specific questions that are relevant to your profile needs, then use the responses to these questions as conditions for your segments.

## Segments, Panels, and Distributions

You can also segment on whether panelists belong (or do not belong) to another segment, you can segment on whether panelists belong (or do not belong) to a panel, and you can segment on whether panelists have received (or not received) a survey distribution.  These types of conditions can be useful for curating audiences specific to your profile needs.

# How Segments Work

    •	**Real-time updates:** As panelists join the panel or update their data (e.g., via surveys), they are automatically added to or removed from segments based on your conditions.
    
    •	**Flexible logic:** Use AND/OR conditions to combine multiple attributes for highly specific targeting. For more complex scenarios, you can add conditions to one or more groups.
    
    •	**Reusable across workflows:** Segments can used when sending surveys to target audiences, sourcing candidates into a study, or reviewing panelist before adding them to a panel.

# Common Use Cases
	•	Identify panelists who use a specific product or service
	•	Narrow in on job roles that handle particular responsibilities
	•	Combine survey responses with profile data for advanced targeting
	•	Build a list of “potential matches” for a study before hand-selecting panelists into a Panel.

# Segments + Panels

Segments are often the **first step** in the recruiting workflow. Once you’ve built a Segment that aligns with your research goals, you can:
	1.	Review matching panelists
	2.	Add selected individuals to a Panel
	3.	Validate with follow-up surveys or begin scheduling
