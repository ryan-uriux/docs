# What is a Segment?

A **Segment** in Panel Pro is a **dynamic group of panelists** that updates in real time based on a set of conditions you define. Segments help you find the right people for your research by applying filters across a wide range of data points collected from panelists.

Unlike [Panels](/clients/panels), which are manually curated lists, segments are automatic — panelists are added or removed as their data changes. If someone updates their profile or completes a new survey, they'll appear in (or drop out of) your segments accordingly.

# Condition Types

When building a segment, you add conditions to define who should be included. There are seven types of conditions available, each filtering on a different dimension of panelist data.

## Panelist Conditions

Filter on panelist profile attributes — the basics of who someone is and where they work.

- **Job Title** — Search for specific job titles. *Example: find all panelists with "Software Engineer" or "Backend Developer" in their title.*
- **Job Level** — Filter by seniority: Entry-Level, Intermediate, Experienced, First-Level Management, Middle Management, Senior Management, Executive/C-Level, Business Owner, or Freelancer.
- **Industry** — Filter by industry category (Technology/IT, Healthcare, Finance, Automotive, and many more).
- **Employment Status** — Filter by employment type: full-time, part-time, self-employed, student, retired, etc.
- **Location** — Find panelists within a radius of a specific location. *Example: panelists within 30 miles of Seattle, WA.*
- **Company Name** — Search by company name (contains, starts with, or doesn't contain).
- **Age** — Filter by age range. *Example: panelists between 25 and 40 years old.*
- **Hourly Rate** — Filter by the panelist's hourly session rate (equal to, greater than, less than, etc.).
- **Last Name** — Search by last name (contains, starts with, or doesn't contain).
- **Email** — Search by email address (contains, starts with, or doesn't contain).

<Tip>
Panelist conditions are great for quick, high-level targeting. Combine a Location condition with a Job Title condition to find, say, all Software Engineers within 50 miles of San Francisco.

## Question Conditions

Filter on responses to [questions](/clients/questions) — both Panel Pro's global questions and your team's survey questions. This is the most common condition type.

- **Answered** — Filter based on how a panelist answered a specific question. The available operators depend on the question type:
  - *Text questions* — contains, doesn't contain, starts with, is empty, is not empty
  - *Number questions* — equals, greater than, less than, between, etc.
  - *Multiple choice questions* — selected any of, selected none of, or (for multi-select) selected all of specific choices
  - *Matrix questions* — same as multiple choice, but scoped to a specific statement (row)
  - *Upload questions* — has uploaded or hasn't uploaded a file
- **Never Answered** — Find panelists who have never responded to a specific question

## Segment Conditions

Filter based on membership in other segments.

- **Belong to any of** — Panelist is a member of at least one of the selected segments
- **Belong to all of** — Panelist is a member of every selected segment
- **Belong to none of** — Panelist is not a member of any of the selected segments

This is useful for building segments that layer on top of each other. *Example: start with a broad "Developers" segment, then create a narrower segment that requires membership in "Developers" plus additional conditions.*

## Panel Conditions

Filter based on membership in [Panels](/clients/panels).

- **Belong to any of** — Panelist is in at least one of the selected panels
- **Belong to all of** — Panelist is in every selected panel
- **Belong to none of** — Panelist is not in any of the selected panels

*Example: exclude panelists who are already in your "Contacted for Study X" panel so you don't reach out to them again.*

## Survey Conditions

Filter based on a panelist's interaction with a specific [survey](/clients/surveys).

- **Completed** — Panelist completed the survey. You can further filter by eligibility state (Qualified, Flex, or Disqualified).
- **Never Taken** — Panelist has never been sent or started the survey.
- **Never Finished** — Panelist started the survey but didn't complete it.

*Example: find panelists who completed your screening survey and were marked as Qualified.*

## Distribution Conditions

Filter based on whether a panelist received a survey distribution.

- **Received** — Panelist was sent an invitation for a specific survey
- **Never Received** — Panelist was never sent an invitation for a specific survey

This is useful for avoiding duplicate outreach. *Example: exclude panelists who already received your latest survey distribution so you can send a follow-up to a fresh audience.*

## Study Conditions

Filter based on a panelist's participation in [studies](/clients/studies).

- **Attended** — Panelist attended a session in a specific study
- **Never Attended** — Panelist has not attended any session within a given time period (e.g., the last 30 days, 6 months, or 1 year)

*Example: find panelists who haven't participated in any study in the last 3 months — useful for reaching out to people who haven't been recently engaged.*

# How Segments Work

- **Real-time updates** — As panelists join the platform or update their data (e.g., by completing surveys), they are automatically added to or removed from segments based on your conditions.
- **Flexible logic** — Use AND/OR conditions to combine multiple attributes for highly specific targeting. For more complex scenarios, you can add conditions to one or more groups.
- **Reusable across workflows** — Segments can be used when distributing surveys, sourcing candidates into a study, or browsing panelists before adding them to a panel.

# Common Use Cases

- Identify panelists who use a specific product or service
- Narrow in on job roles that handle particular responsibilities
- Combine survey responses with profile data for advanced targeting
- Build a list of potential matches for a study before hand-selecting panelists into a [Panel](/clients/panels)

# Segments + Panels

Segments are often the **first step** in the recruiting workflow. Once you've built a segment that aligns with your research goals, you can:

1. Review matching panelists in the [Panelist Viewer](/clients/panelist-viewer)
2. Add selected individuals to a Panel for future use
3. Distribute a survey to the segment, or source candidates directly into a [Study](/clients/studies)
