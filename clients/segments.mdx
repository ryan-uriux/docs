# What is a Segment?

A **Segment** in Panel Pro is a **dynamic group of panelists** that updates in real time based on a set of conditions you define. Segments help you find the right people for your research by applying filters across a wide range of data points collected from panelists.

Unlike [Panels](/clients/panels), which are manually curated lists, segments are automatic — panelists are added or removed as their data changes. If someone updates their profile or completes a new survey, they'll appear in (or drop out of) your segments accordingly.

# What Can You Segment On?

## Panel Pro Questions

The most common use case is segmenting on responses to [questions](/clients/questions). Out of the box, Panel Pro includes pre-profiled panelists who have already responded to dozens, if not hundreds, of questions. These global questions are shared across clients and are useful for creating high-level segments right away — no survey work needed.

## Your Team's Questions

You can also segment on responses to your own questions — questions you've sent to panelists via [Surveys](/clients/surveys). The responses to these questions are scoped to your team and are never shared across clients. This means you can ask panelists very specific questions relevant to your profile needs, then use those responses as segment conditions.

## Segments, Panels, and Distributions

Beyond question responses, you can segment on whether panelists:

- Belong (or don't belong) to another **segment**
- Belong (or don't belong) to a **panel**
- Have received (or haven't received) a **survey distribution**

These conditions are useful for excluding people you've already contacted, targeting people in a specific panel, or building on top of existing segments.

# How Segments Work

- **Real-time updates** — As panelists join the platform or update their data (e.g., by completing surveys), they are automatically added to or removed from segments based on your conditions.
- **Flexible logic** — Use AND/OR conditions to combine multiple attributes for highly specific targeting. For more complex scenarios, you can add conditions to one or more groups.
- **Reusable across workflows** — Segments can be used when distributing surveys, sourcing candidates into a study, or browsing panelists before adding them to a panel.

# Common Use Cases

- Identify panelists who use a specific product or service
- Narrow in on job roles that handle particular responsibilities
- Combine survey responses with profile data for advanced targeting
- Build a list of potential matches for a study before hand-selecting panelists into a [Panel](/clients/panels)

# Segments + Panels

Segments are often the **first step** in the recruiting workflow. Once you've built a segment that aligns with your research goals, you can:

1. Review matching panelists in the [Panelist Viewer](/clients/panelist-viewer)
2. Add selected individuals to a Panel for future use
3. Distribute a survey to the segment, or source candidates directly into a [Study](/clients/studies)
