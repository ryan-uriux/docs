# Getting Started with Panel Pro

You don't sign up for Panel Pro on your own — the team at **URI (User Research International)** sets up your organization for you. Once your organization is ready, URI will send an invite to your designated point of contact. That person becomes the **Admin** of the account.

Interested in getting started? Reach out to [support@uriux.com](mailto:support@uriux.com) and someone from the team will get you set up.

# Accepting Your Invite

When URI sends your invite, you'll receive an email with a link to accept. Click the link, create your account, and you're in. You'll land in your organization's Panel Pro dashboard with full Admin access.

# Inviting Your Team

As an Admin, one of the first things you'll want to do is invite the rest of your team. Panel Pro does not charge per user, so add as many people as you need at no additional cost.

To invite someone, navigate to `Manage Organization` from your profile menu, then go to `Invitations` and click `+ Invite User`. Enter their email address and select a role. They'll receive an email where they can accept the invite and create their account — once they do, they're part of your organization.

For step-by-step instructions with screenshots, see [Invite Team Members](/clients/invitations).

# Roles

Everyone in your organization has access to the same resources — the same panels, segments, surveys, and studies. The difference is what each person can **do** with those resources, which depends on their role.

- **Admin** — Can manage the organization (invite and manage team members) and create and manage all resources (panels, segments, surveys, studies).
- **Creator** — Can create and manage resources but cannot manage the organization or invite team members.
- **Viewer** — Can view all resources but cannot create or modify them. Ideal for stakeholders who need visibility into research without making changes.

<Note>
Only Admins can invite new team members and manage the organization. If you need someone to have invite privileges, make sure they have the Admin role.

# What's Next?

Once your team is set up, you're ready to start using Panel Pro. Here are good places to start:

- **[Panels](/clients/panels)** — Create curated audiences for your research
- **[Segments](/clients/segments)** — Build dynamic groups based on panelist data
- **[Surveys](/clients/surveys)** — Design and distribute surveys to collect data
- **[Studies](/clients/studies)** — Organize research sessions and schedule participants
