# What is a panel?

A panel is Panel Pro is not a panel in the traditional sense.  It is not a pool of thousands of people that you profile and recruit from.  Rather, a panel in Panel Pro is a curated list of people, curated to meet your specific needs.

Think of panels like a reusable audience.  Researchers or recruiters can use panels as a target audience when sending out surveys, or they can source candidates into a study from a panel.

# Create your first panel

To create your first panel, simply navigate to the Panels page and click on the `+ Create Panel` button.  Give you panel a name and description and voila\!  You're done\!  But of course a panel isn't useful without any panelists in it, so let's add some folks to our panel.

## Adding panelist to a panel

You can add panelists to a panel from pretty much anywhere in the app.  Whether you are viewing members of a segment, respondents of a survey, or candidates for a study, when you click on a panelist the Panelist Viewer will pop up and display the panelist's profile.  On the top-right hand of the panelist's profile is a `...` menu with an `Add to Panel...` option.  Simply select the panel you would like to add the panelist to and the panelist will become a member of your panel.

Panelists are not notified that they have been added to a panel.  They will not receive invites to paid surveys or studies by being a member of a panel.  A panel is simply a list of panelists curated by you so that you can easily group people of certain attributes.

# How to use a panel

Panels can be used in various ways, but most of the time you'll likely be using panels to send surveys to a targeted audience, or to pull in candidates for a study.  We'll cover those use cases and more in this section.

## Panels as a Target Audience for a Survey

Let's say you have a product you're working on, and you want to know if people who use that product prefer the UI to be displayed in light mode, dark mode, or if they prefer to use their system's settings.  You already built a panel of people who you know use your product and you also have a survey ready to go that asks them about their preferred modes.  Now you want to send this survey to a certain number of people in your panel, let's say n = 20.

Navigate to your survey and click on `Distributions`.  Click `+ Create Distribution` and give your distribution a name.  Under Target Audience, select `Panel Condition`.  This will add a condition to your Target Audience:

> Include panelists...
>
> Who belong to `any` of the panels `[Choose panels]`

Select your desired panel, punch in a Target Response Count, and launch your survey\!  Conversely, you can also launch to panelists who do not belong to one or more of your panels by changing `any` to `none` .
