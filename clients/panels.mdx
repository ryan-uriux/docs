# What is a panel?

A panel is Panel Pro is not a panel in the traditional sense.  It is not a pool of thousands of people that you screen and recruit from.  Rather, a panel in Panel Pro is a curated list of people, curated to meet your specific profile needs.

Think of panels like a reusable audience.  Researchers or recruiters can use panels as a target audience when sending out surveys, or they can source candidates into a study from a panel.

# Create your first panel

To create your first panel, simply navigate to the Panels page and click on the `+ Create Panel` button.  Give your panel a name and description and voila\!  You're done\!  But of course a panel isn't useful without any panelists in it, so let's add some panelists to your panel.

## Adding panelists to a panel

You can add panelists to a panel from pretty much anywhere in the app.  Whether you are viewing members of a segment, respondents of a survey, or candidates for a study, when you click on a panelist the Panelist Viewer will pop up and display the panelist's profile.  On the top-right hand of the panelist's profile is a `...` menu with an `Add to Panel...` option.  Simply select the panel you would like to add the panelist to and the panelist will become a member of your panel.

Panelists are not notified that they have been added to a panel.  They will not receive invites to paid surveys or studies by being a member of a panel.  A panel is simply a list of panelists curated by you so that you can easily group people of certain attributes.

# How to use a panel

Panels can be used in various ways, but the most common use cases are using panels as a target audiences to send surveys to, or adding candidates to a study from a panel.  We'll cover those use cases and more in this section.

## Panels as a Target Audience for a Survey

Let's say you have a product you're working on, and you want to know if people who uses the product prefer the UI to be displayed in light mode, dark mode, or if they prefer to use their system's settings.  You already built a panel of people who you know use your product and you also have a survey ready to go that asks them about their preferred modes.  Now you want to send this survey to a certain number of people in your panel, let's say n = 20.

Navigate to your survey and click on `Distributions`.  Click `+ Create Distribution` and give your distribution a name.  Under Target Audience, select `Panel Condition`.  This will add a condition to your Target Audience:

> Include panelists...
>
> Who belong to `any` of the panels `[Choose panels]`

Select your desired panel, punch in a Target Response Count, and launch your survey\!  Conversely, you can also launch to panelists who do not belong to one or more of your panels by changing `any` to `none`.

## Panels as a Source for a Study Candidates

In this scenario, let's say you have already profiled a set of panelists and added them to a panel called "Product Y Users," and you are running a qualitative study on users of Product Y.  In the `Studies` section of the app, you have already created a study for your research and now you want to add candidates to your study so you can invite them to participate in sessions.

Navigate to your study and clicked on the `Candidates` link in the left-hand navigation menu.  Click the `Add Canddiates` button.  This will bring up a dialog where you can source candidates from various resources in the platform.  Select `Panel` from the tab bar at the top, then select the panel you would like to source candidates from (Product Y Users).  Punch in the number of candidates you would like to source (try to keep it small, close to the number of participants you need for your study), then click the `Add Candidates` button to bring the panelists into your study as candidates. You can now review these candidates, approve or reject them, and invite approved candidates to participate in your sessions.
