# Inviting Team Members

Panel Pro does not charge per user, so add as many team members as you need at no additional cost.

To invite someone, click on your profile icon in the top-right corner of the screen and select `Manage Organization`. From there, click `Invitations` in the left-hand navigation menu, then click `+ Invite User`.

Enter your team member's email address, select their role, and click `Send Invite`. Your team member will receive an email with a link where they can accept the invitation and create their account. Once they do, they're part of your organization and can start using the platform right away.

# Roles

Everyone in your organization has access to the same resources — the same panels, segments, surveys, and studies. The difference is what each person can do with those resources, which depends on their role.

- **Admin** — Can manage the organization (invite and manage team members) and create and manage all resources (panels, segments, surveys, studies).
- **Creator** — Can create and manage resources (panels, segments, surveys, studies) but cannot manage the organization or invite team members.
- **Viewer** — Can view all resources (panels, segments, surveys, studies) but cannot create or modify them. Ideal for stakeholders who need visibility into research without making changes.

<Note>
Only Admins can invite new team members. If you need someone to have invite privileges, make sure they have the Admin role.
