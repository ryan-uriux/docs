# The Viewer

Throughout Panel Pro, clicking on a person opens a **viewer** — a side panel that shows you everything you need to know about that individual so you can make informed decisions. The viewer appears in several different contexts across the platform, and each context adds relevant information on top of the same core profile.

The underlying person is always a panelist, but depending on where you are in the platform, you're looking at them through a different lens. That context matters because it determines what information is most useful to you at that moment.

# Panelist Viewer

The **Panelist Viewer** is the base version of the viewer. You'll see it when browsing panelists in a segment, a panel, or anywhere else you're looking at people outside the context of a specific survey or study.

The Panelist Viewer shows the panelist's **profile** — the collection of data points Panel Pro has gathered about them through profiling surveys and your team's surveys. This includes demographics, employment details, technical skills, product usage, and any other questions they've responded to.

From the Panelist Viewer, you can:

- Review the panelist's profile data and question responses
- Add the panelist to a panel via the `...` menu
- See which panels and segments the panelist belongs to

This is the viewer you'll use most often when you're building panels, browsing segments, or exploring your audience before starting a study.

# Respondent Viewer

The **Respondent Viewer** appears when you're looking at someone in the context of a **survey**. When you navigate to a survey's responses and click on a respondent, the viewer opens with their profile plus the additional context of their survey interaction.

On top of the standard profile, the Respondent Viewer shows:

- **Survey responses** — The respondent's answers to each question in the survey
- **Eligibility state** — Whether the respondent was Qualified, Disqualified, Flex, or Unknown
- **Labels** — Any labels applied to the respondent during the survey

The Respondent Viewer is where you'll spend time reviewing individual answers, reading open-text responses, and deciding which respondents are strong candidates for a follow-up study.

# Candidate Viewer

The **Candidate Viewer** appears when you're looking at someone in the context of a **study**. When you navigate to a study's candidates and click on a person, the viewer opens with everything you need to make an approval decision.

The Candidate Viewer includes:

- **Panelist profile** — The same profile data from the Panelist Viewer
- **Survey responses** — If the candidate was sourced from a survey, their responses are shown here so you can review their answers without leaving the study
- **Approval status** — The candidate's current state in the approval workflow (Needs Review, Approved, Rejected, Hold)

This is the most information-rich version of the viewer. It brings together profile data, survey responses, and study-specific status in one place so you can review candidates efficiently and make approval decisions without switching between different parts of the platform.

# Why Context Matters

The viewer is the same core component throughout Panel Pro — it's always showing you a panelist's profile. But the context you're in determines what additional information is layered on top.

- Browsing a **segment** or **panel**? You see the Panelist Viewer with profile data — enough to decide if someone fits your audience.
- Reviewing **survey responses**? You see the Respondent Viewer with their answers and eligibility — enough to evaluate their survey performance.
- Approving **study candidates**? You see the Candidate Viewer with profile, survey responses, and approval status — everything you need to decide if they should be invited to sessions.

<Tip>
You don't need to think about which viewer to use — Panel Pro automatically shows the right one based on where you are. Click on a person and you'll always get the information that's most relevant to what you're doing.
