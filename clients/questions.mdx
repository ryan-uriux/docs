# What are Questions?

Questions are the building blocks of everything you do in Panel Pro. Every time a panelist responds to a survey, their answers are stored as **question responses** — structured data points that you can use to segment audiences, target distributions, and inform your research decisions.

Panel Pro tracks hundreds of data points across categories like demographics, employment history, technology usage, industry experience, and more. These data points come from two sources: questions asked by Panel Pro itself, and questions asked by your team through your own surveys.

# Panel Pro Questions

Panel Pro continuously profiles panelists through its own surveys, collecting responses to a wide range of questions covering demographics, professional background, technical skills, and more. These are **global questions** — their responses are shared across all clients on the platform.

Panel Pro questions are useful for high-level segmentation. For example, you might use Panel Pro question responses to find panelists who work in healthcare, use a specific operating system, or hold a certain job title. Because Panel Pro has already collected this data, you can start segmenting immediately without needing to send your own survey first.

# Your Team's Questions

When you create and distribute your own surveys, the questions in those surveys become **your team's questions**. The responses to these questions are scoped entirely to your team — they are never shared with other clients on the platform.

This is where things get powerful. You can ask panelists highly specific questions that are relevant to your exact research needs, and then use those responses to build precise segments. For example, you might survey panelists about which features of your product they use most frequently, then create a segment of people who selected a particular feature.

<Note>
Your team's questions and their responses are completely private. Other clients on the platform will never see your questions or the data you collect.

# Browsing Questions

To see all available questions, navigate to the **Questions** section in the platform. You'll find both Panel Pro's global questions and your team's questions listed here. You can search and filter through questions to find the data points you need for your segments or to review what's already been collected.

This is a great place to start when planning a new segment or survey — browse the existing questions first to see if the data you need has already been collected before designing a new survey.

# Leveraging Panel Pro Questions

This is what makes Panel Pro fundamentally different from traditional recruiting. Before you ever send a single survey, Panel Pro has already collected hundreds of data points from every panelist — demographics, job roles, technical skills, product usage, industry experience, and much more. That data is ready for you to use **immediately**.

## Targeting With Panel Pro Questions

You can use Panel Pro questions to target audiences across the platform without any upfront survey work. Need to find Android developers who work at companies with 500+ employees? Panel Pro already has that data. Build a segment, set up your distribution conditions, or source study candidates — all from day one, using data that's already been collected.

This means you can go from "I need people who match this profile" to "I'm sending them a survey" in minutes, not days. There's no cold-start problem — Panel Pro's profiling data gives you a massive head start on finding the right people.

## Question Sets

**Question Sets** let you bundle Panel Pro questions into a named collection that you want to track for your research. When you create a Question Set, the responses to those questions become easily accessible in two ways:

- **In the app** — Review Question Set responses when viewing panelists, respondents, or candidates. Instead of scrolling through hundreds of data points, your Question Set surfaces the specific answers you care about.
- **In exports** — Question Set responses are included when you export data, so you can pull the exact data points you need into your own tools and reports.

Question Sets are especially useful when your research focuses on a specific domain. For example, if you're studying how people use cloud infrastructure, create a Question Set with Panel Pro's questions about cloud providers, DevOps tools, and infrastructure management. Those responses will then be front and center whenever you're reviewing panelists — in the viewer, in candidate lists, and in your exports.

# How Questions Power Your Research

Questions are the connective tissue between surveys, segments, and studies. Here's how they fit together:

- **Segment conditions** — Use question responses as conditions when building segments. For example, create a segment of panelists who answered "Yes" to a specific question, or who selected a particular option from a multiple choice question.

- **Distribution targeting** — When distributing a survey, you can target panelists based on their responses to previous questions using ad-hoc conditions or segment-based targeting.

- **Screening and qualification** — Design surveys with questions that help you identify the right participants for your studies, then use those responses to make recruiting decisions.

<Tip>
Questions cannot be copied into new surveys individually, but you can use **survey reference blocks** to embed an entire survey within another survey. This is useful when you want to reuse a standard set of profiling questions across multiple surveys.
