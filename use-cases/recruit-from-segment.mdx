# Schedule People Directly From a Segment

This is the most straightforward recruiting workflow in Panel Pro. You've already built a segment of panelists who match your profile needs, and you want to schedule them into a study without an additional screening step.

*Let's say you're researching how IT administrators manage device fleets, and you've already built a segment of panelists who work in IT and manage 50+ devices. You're confident this segment captures the right people, so you want to skip screening and go straight to scheduling.*

## Step 1: Build Your Segment

Navigate to **Segments** and create a new segment (or use an existing one). Define conditions using Panel Pro questions, your team's questions, or a combination of both. For our example, you might combine conditions like:

- Job function is "IT / Systems Administration"
- Response to "How many devices do you manage?" is 50 or more

Your segment will dynamically populate with panelists who match these conditions. Review the segment members to make sure the audience looks right.

For more on building segments, see [Segments](/clients/segments).

## Step 2: Create a Study

Navigate to **Studies** and click `+ Create Study`. Give it a name, write a participant-facing description that explains what the study is about, and add any notification recipients from your team.

Then set up your sessions — define the time slots, duration, host, location, and any instructions participants need.

## Step 3: Add Candidates from Your Segment

In your study, navigate to `Candidates` and click `Add Candidates`. Select **Segment** as your source and choose the segment you built in Step 1. Specify how many candidates you'd like to pull in — try to keep this close to the number of participants you actually need, rather than importing your entire segment.

The selected panelists will be added to your study as candidates in the **Needs Review** state.

## Step 4: Review & Invite

Review each candidate in the Candidate Viewer, which shows their panelist profile and question responses. For each candidate, choose one of:

- **Approved** — They're a good fit, clear to invite
- **Rejected** — They don't meet your needs for this study
- **Hold** — You're not sure yet, come back to them later

Once you've approved your candidates, invite them to participate. They'll receive a notification with your study details and a link to schedule.

## Step 5: Participants Schedule

Invited participants can view available sessions and self-schedule into a time slot that works for them. If you've set up sessions with label requirements or marked sessions as invite-only, participants will only see the sessions they're eligible for. Calendar invites are sent automatically.

## Gratuity

Participants are paid their **hourly rate** (typically \$100–\$150/hr based on skills and experience) multiplied by the session duration, plus any session bonus you've configured. For example, a participant with a \$125/hr rate attending a 60-minute session earns \$125.

<Tip>
This workflow works best when you're confident in your segment criteria and don't need to screen further. If you want to review survey responses before scheduling, see [Survey People, Then Schedule](/use-cases/recruit-from-survey) instead.
