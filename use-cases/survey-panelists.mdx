# Survey Panelists

Surveys are the primary way to collect data from panelists in Panel Pro. Whether you're profiling panelists for future research, screening candidates for a study, or conducting standalone survey research, the workflow starts here.

*Let's say you want to understand how your panelists use AI tools in their daily work. You'll design a survey with the right questions, target the right audience, distribute it, and monitor the results as they come in.*

## Designing Your Survey

Navigate to **Surveys** and create a new survey. The block-based designer lets you build your survey from three types of blocks:

- **Question blocks** — The data you're collecting (Text, Number, Multiple Choice, Matrix, Upload)
- **Action blocks** — Logic that controls the survey flow (Disqualify, Flex, Jump, Label, Redirect)
- **Container blocks** — Structure for organizing your survey (Sections with optional randomization, Survey Endings)

Every block can have a **condition** that controls when it's shown, so you can build branching surveys that adapt to each respondent's answers.

For a detailed overview of the survey designer and all block types, see [Surveys](/clients/surveys).

## Targeting Your Audience

When you're ready to distribute your survey, you have two approaches for defining who receives it:

### Distribute Against a Segment

If you've already built a **segment** that matches the audience you want, use it as your target audience. Navigate to your survey's `Distributions` tab, create a new distribution, and select your segment.

This is ideal when you have a well-defined audience you survey repeatedly — your segment stays up to date automatically, and you can distribute new surveys to it whenever needed.

### Ad-hoc Conditions

If you don't have a pre-built segment (or want to target a slightly different audience for this specific survey), define **ad-hoc conditions** directly on the distribution. These work just like segment conditions — you can filter on Panel Pro questions, your team's questions, panel membership, and more — but they live on the distribution rather than being saved as a reusable segment.

Ad-hoc conditions are great for one-off surveys where building a permanent segment isn't worth the effort.

## Distribution Settings

When creating a distribution, you'll set a **target response count** — the number of completed responses you need. You'll also see a **cost estimate** based on your survey length and target count, so you know what to expect before launching.

Once you launch the distribution, Panel Pro handles the rest. The platform sends survey invitations in **waves**, targeting your exact response count within **24 hours**. Rather than blasting your entire audience at once, it sends out a wave of invitations, waits to see how many responses come in, and then sends the next wave — adjusting as it goes to land as close to your target as possible. You can monitor progress in real time and pause or stop the distribution at any time.

The platform automatically excludes panelists who have already received or completed the survey, so you never have to worry about duplicate sends.

## Gratuity

Panelists are paid for every survey they take. Gratuity is calculated **per question** based on the estimated time to complete each question, working out to roughly **\$1 per minute** per respondent, with a minimum cost of **\$0.50 per respondent**. Everyone gets paid for taking surveys — we value participants' time, and fair compensation is fundamental to the quality of responses you receive.

For example, a short screening survey that takes 1–5 minutes to complete would cost roughly \$1–\$5 per respondent. If 100 people complete a 3-minute survey, that's approximately \$300.

If your survey uses **End Survey When Disqualified**, disqualified respondents exit early and answer fewer questions, which reduces the per-respondent cost. Your distribution's cost estimate accounts for this.

## Monitoring Results

Once your distribution is live, head to your survey's **Dashboard** to track progress. You'll see four metrics:

- **Completions** — The total number of completed responses, along with when the latest completion came in
- **Qualification Rate** — The percentage of respondents who ended up Qualified, with a count breakdown
- **Flex Rate** — The percentage of respondents who ended up in the Flex state
- **Disqualification Rate** — The percentage of respondents who were disqualified

These metrics update as responses come in. If your qualification rate is low, you might want to refine your segment conditions or review your disqualification criteria. You can also navigate to the **Respondents** page to review individual responses and dig into specific answers.

If you're surveying to screen people for a study, your next step is to import qualified respondents as study candidates. See [Survey People, Then Schedule](/use-cases/recruit-from-survey) for the full workflow.
