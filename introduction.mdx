## Why Panel Pro?

Panel Pro gives you access to a **pre-profiled panel of thousands of professionals** — each with hundreds of data points already collected. No cold-start problem, no waiting for responses before you can start targeting. Here's what sets the platform apart:

- **Pre-profiled panelists** — Panel Pro continuously collects demographics, employment data, technical skills, product usage, and more from every panelist. You can start building segments and targeting audiences from day one.

- **Precision targeting** — Build dynamic segments using any combination of panelist data, then distribute surveys or source study candidates from those segments. Target exactly who you need, when you need them.

- **Built-in survey designer** — Design branching, conditional surveys with screening logic, disqualification checkpoints, and labeling — all in a block-based editor. No external tools required.

- **End-to-end recruiting** — Go from targeting an audience to distributing a screening survey to scheduling study sessions, all within one platform. No juggling spreadsheets or switching between tools.

- **Fair panelist compensation** — Panelists are paid for every survey they take and compensated at competitive hourly rates for study sessions. Fair pay means higher quality responses and more engaged participants.

- **Multi-phase studies** — Run complex research projects with multiple session types in a single study. Use labels to gate phases so participants progress naturally from screening to deep-dive interviews.

- **Your data stays yours** — Questions you ask and responses you collect are scoped to your team and never shared with other clients on the platform.
